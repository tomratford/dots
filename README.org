#+TITLE: My Emacs Config

Whilst I was creating my emacs config, I felt it especially useful to find other literal emacs configs to base mine off of. As a result, to 'pay it forward' here is my emacs config. Put under 'dots' because I'm sure as/when I wrote other literal configs I will putt hem in this repo for others to see.
