#+TITLE: My Dotfiles

* Emacs

Whilst I was creating my emacs config, I felt it especially useful to find other literal emacs configs to base mine off of. As a result, to 'pay it forward' my emacs config is publically available so others can do the same. It it not especially literate but that is a WIP, but it is hopefully clearly laid out and available for you to get some ideas from.
